# Customer_Review_Sentiment_Analysis
The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews using the DistilBERT model
from the HuggingFace Transformers library. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment
expressed in a piece of text, which in this case is whether a customer review is positive or negative.
